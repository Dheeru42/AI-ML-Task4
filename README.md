# ðŸ“„ Summary of Steps Performed

This document outlines the structured steps taken in the Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

---

**Step 1:** Imported all the required Python libraries for data handling, model building, and evaluation.

**Step 2:** Loaded the dataset into the environment for analysis.

**Step 3:** Inspected the dataset's shape to understand the number of records and features.

**Step 4:** Displayed and explored the dataset to understand its structure and values.

**Step 5:** Converted categorical class labels (diagnosis column) into numerical values using label encoding.

**Step 6:** Verified the data transformation after encoding the target column.

**Step 7:** Initiated the model training phase.

**Step 8:** Segregated the dataset into features (`X`) and target labels (`y`) to prepare for model training.

**Step 9:** Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

**Step 10:** Applied feature scaling to normalize the feature values.

**Step 11:** Imported the chosen machine learning model and fitted it to the training data.

**Step 12:** Evaluated and printed the model's accuracy on the training data.

**Step 13:** Evaluated and printed the model's accuracy on the testing data.

**Step 14:** Generated predictions using the model on the testing dataset.

**Step 15:** Evaluated model performance using various metrics including confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

**Step 16:** Imported the necessary functions from `sklearn.metrics` to compute evaluation metrics.

**Step 17:** Constructed and analyzed the confusion matrix to assess classification accuracy.

**Step 18:** Computed precision and recall scores to measure the model's ability to correctly classify positive cases.

**Step 19:** Calculated the ROC-AUC score to evaluate the overall performance of the classifier.

**Step 20:** Plotted the ROC curve to visualize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate.

**Step 21:** Experimented with different probability thresholds to observe their effect on model predictions.

**Step 22:** Analyzed model behavior and performance under various classification thresholds.
